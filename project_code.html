                <h3><b>One of the most effective practices of self-care </b></h3>
                <p>Journaling is an exercise that has been around for well over thousands of years.<br />
                    Journaling follows a simple process of writing your thoughts without any rules or restrictions. The
                    act of self-reflection and routinely putting one’s experiences, feelings, beliefs, and emotions on
                    paper can do more good than just help you feel better.<br /><br />

                    Especially when it comes to self-improvement and leading a mindful life, journaling can be a great
                    tool.</p>

                <p>
                    Mindful journaling is asking yourself why you feel a certain way and then letting it go out of your
                    head and onto the paper. You question yourself about yourself and get to know your values, your
                    motives, the way you think, and how you feel.<br /><br />You take into consideration more possible
                    outcomes, study your situation, and thus shift your mindset. With the clarity of your thoughts, You
                    stop going in the past, don't look into the future, and become truly present and mindful of your
                    life. </p>

                    </b></h3>
                <p>
                    Journaling allows you to openly express your emotions that you usually keep bottled up. You get an
                    opportunity to have full emotional disclosure and vent without ever being judged. This helps you
                    feel lighter. Seeing your thoughts written in front of you in their true form without any edits
                    helps you see the authenticity of your thinking.<br /><br />
                    In doing so, you identify your triggers and learn to better handle them. When you write down and
                    figure out the thoughts that are upsetting, you feel happier, calmer, less anxious, and experience
                    overall better mental health.

                <p>Journaling is your private space for decision making without any judgment or pressure. This
                    facilitates new perspectives and idea generation. You write different possible scenarios, examine
                    the positive and negative implications, and make better choices.

                    <br /><br /> You build self-awareness and discover things in your mind that might be affecting your
                    behavior and moods. You make your decisions and explanations more realistic and improvise better
                    ways to achieve your goals. You may find out that the thing you are stressing about might not be
                    that big of a deal and this helps you approach it in a more bold manner.

                <p>Has been keeping journals since she was 13 years old. She considers them to be her
                    therapy
                    sessions.
                    They're all simple leather diaries, locked away in a safe in her home. Every
                    boyfriend,
                    every
                    relationship, her friendships, her work, her family — all of them are dissected on
                    pages.
                    Jen is
                    not
                    the type to get into huge, verbal altercations with her boyfriends; her way of
                    dealing
                    with
                    relationship issues has always been to write in her diary, then have a discussion.
                    That
                    way
                    she
                    always has the upper hand in fights, and never loses control.</p>
